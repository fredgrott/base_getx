Arch and Project Layout is a modification of RxVMS coined by 
Thomas Burkart at
https://www.burkharts.net/apps/blog/rxvms-a-practical-architecture-for-flutter-apps/
and its based on his 20 years exp in softwre and hisrecent 4 yearsmobile dev with Xamarin Forms.

I modified his idea to include getX specific stuff and yet i still call my getX controllers 
managers as it makes more sense to do it that way.
